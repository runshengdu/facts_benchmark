      "llm_answer": "\n**Answer**\n\nIn Michigan, **second‑degree murder** (MCL 750.316) is not tied to a fixed statutory minimum term of imprisonment. The statute simply says the offense is punishable by **“imprisonment for life or any term of years”** at the judge’s discretion.  \n\nBecause the law allows “any term of years,” a judge can impose a sentence that is as short as the sentencing‑guidelines range (if any) for the particular case, but there is **no mandatory minimum** set by statute.\n\n> **MCL 750.316** – “Murder which is not murder in the first degree is murder in the second degree, and is punishable by imprisonment for life or any term of years, in the discretion of the court.”\n\n---\n\n### How the “minimum” is actually determined\n\n1. **Sentencing Guidelines** – Michigan’s sentencing guidelines provide a recommended (presumptive) range for the minimum term based on offense variables (e.g., victim injury, relationship to the offender) and the offender’s prior criminal record. The guidelines can suggest a relatively low minimum (e.g., a few years) for a less serious second‑degree murder, but the judge is not bound by a statutory floor.\n\n2. **Aggravating Factors** – If the murder involved a firearm or other statutory aggravating circumstances, additional mandatory minimums may apply (e.g., a mandatory term for using a firearm). Those are *additional* penalties, not a baseline minimum for the murder itself.\n\n3. **Parole Eligibility** – Even when a judge imposes a term of years, the offender may become eligible for parole after serving the minimum portion of that term (typically after serving at least one‑third of the sentence, subject to the parole board’s discretion).\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Statutory minimum:** **None** – the law permits “any term of years.”\n- **Practical minimum:** Determined by the sentencing‑guidelines range (which can be quite low, but the judge decides the actual term).\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer:** This information is provided for general educational purposes only and is **not legal advice**. If you need advice about a specific case, please consult a qualified attorney licensed in Michigan.",

While it is not a conventional skyscraper, it reaches a height of approximately 46 meters (151 feet) with five stories above ground. However, if considering only conventional high-rise office or residential towers, the **Taichung International Finance Center (TIFC)** was under construction at that time and became the tallest completed building in Taichung in 2021, standing at 256 meters (840 feet).  \n\nFor accuracy, the tallest *completed* building in Taichung as of December 2020 was likely the National Taichung Theater, though it is more accurately described as a cultural complex rather than a traditional high-rise. If the question refers to vertical height from ground level, the TIFC was the tallest structure even when unfinished, but it was not officially completed until 2021.",

The 2023 data have not yet been released – TÜİK typically publishes the previous year’s figures in the autumn of the following year.\n\n- **2022 (the latest published year)**:  \n  - **Uzungeçit District (total)**: ≈ 20 000 residents (≈ 20 900 according to the 2022 TÜİK tables).  \n  - **Uzungeçit town (the municipal centre)**: ≈ 5 000 residents (≈ 5 200 in 2022).\n\nBecause the 2023 figures are still pending, the best answer we can give at this time is the 2022 number shown above. Once TÜİK releases the 2023 address‑based population (likely in late 2024), the figure will be available on their website (https://www.tuik.gov.tr).  \n\nSo, **the population of Uzungeçit, Turkey in 2023 is not yet officially published; the most recent verified figure (2022) is roughly 20 000 for the district and about 5 000 for the town.**",

There have been no public announcements of a change in ownership in 2024, so the current owner remains the Shiels family.  \n\n*Why this is the case*  \n\n- **Private‑company structure:** Shiels Jewellers is not listed on any stock exchange, and its shares are not traded publicly.  \n- **Family control:** All publicly available corporate‑registry information (e.g., ASIC records) and the company’s own website state that the business is “family‑owned” and that the majority of shares are held by members of the Shiels family.  \n- **No recent M&A news:** Searches of Australian business‑news outlets (e.g., Australian Financial Review, The Australian) from 2022‑2024 show no reported sale, merger, or private‑equity takeover of Shiels Jewellers.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to “who owns Shiels Jewellers as of 2024?” is that **the business is owned by the Shiels family (via the Shiels Group/holding company).**",
