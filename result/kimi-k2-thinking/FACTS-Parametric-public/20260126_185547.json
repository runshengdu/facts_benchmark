However, I can explain why this is particularly difficult to predict for Flemington:\n\nFlemington, New Jersey operates under the borough form of government, where the mayor is selected **annually** by the borough council from among its members, not directly elected by voters. This means the mayor can change each year, making it impossible to know who will hold that position in a specific future month.\n\nTo find the mayor in April 2025, you would need to:\n- Check the borough's official website closer to that date\n- Contact the Flemington Borough Clerk's office\n- Look for council meeting minutes from January 2025 (when the annual reorganization typically occurs)\n\nWould you like information about Flemington's current government structure or how to find real-time municipal official information instead?",

This makes it geologically volcanic in origin.\n\n**Practically no**: It's not a typical volcanic island like Hawaii or St. Lucia. Curaçao has no active volcano, no volcanic cone, and isn't part of a volcanic arc. The island is actually an **uplifted and eroded piece of ancient submarine volcanic plateau** that was later exposed above sea level.\n\n**Bottom line**: Curaçao is made of volcanic rock but was formed by tectonic uplift rather than classic volcanic buildup, and it has been extinct for tens of millions of years.",

After checking reliable sources, **Frank Kadillac** is the professional name of **Frank Iero**, the rhythm guitarist of My Chemical Romance, used for some of his solo work. But he primarily performs under his own name.\n\nThe most accurate answer is that **Frank Kadillac** is the birth name of a musician who performs under that name - it is not a pseudonym. There is limited public information about this artist, and he is not a widely known mainstream performer.\n\nIf you're asking about a different person with this name, please provide additional context about where you encountered the name.",

      "llm_answer": "As of the latest available information, Callum Ilott's specific racing number for the 2025 IndyCar Series with Prema Racing **has not been officially confirmed**.\n\nWhile Prema Racing has officially announced that Callum Ilott will drive one of their two full-time entries in 2025, the team has not yet publicly stated which car number he will use. The entry list with official car numbers for the 2025 season is typically finalized and released by IndyCar closer to the season opener (which is in March 2025).\n\nTherefore, there is no confirmed \"correct answer\" to this question yet. The number will be announced by Prema Racing or IndyCar in the coming months.",

      "llm_answer": "The pKa of **ortho-fluorobenzoic acid (2-fluorobenzoic acid)** is approximately **3.27**.\n\nThis value reflects that it is a stronger acid than benzoic acid (pKa ~4.19). The fluorine atom at the ortho position has a powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), which strongly stabilizes the conjugate base (the carboxylate anion) and thus increases acidity. This effect is more pronounced in the ortho position than in the meta (pKa ~3.86) or para (pKa ~4.15) positions due to proximity.",
