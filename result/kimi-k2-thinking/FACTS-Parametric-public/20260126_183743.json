You might be asking about:\n- **Last Resident Program**: In DOS systems, the last TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) program loaded\n- **License Manager**: GAMS uses a license file; \"last resident\" might refer to the most recent user/seat checked out\n\n## Alternative Interpretations:\n\n### Gaming Context\nIf you meant **\"Games\"** (\"gamsutl\" = phonetic typo):\n-  **\"Last Resident\"**  : Could refer to the final player remaining in a multiplayer game or the last character in a survival game. There's no standard utility with this name.\n\n### Legal/Real Estate Context\nIf \"last resident\" is your main query:\n- **Probate Law**: The final person who lived at a property before death or transfer\n- **Eviction**: The last remaining tenant in a building\n\n---\n\n**To give you the correct answer, could you clarify:**\n- What system/software are you using?\n- What context is this in (programming, gaming, legal)?\n\n**Example clarification**: *\"Are you asking about a GAMS command-line utility, or something else?\"*",
