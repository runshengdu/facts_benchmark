Carbon has 4 valence electrons, but loses 1 electron due to the +1 charge, leaving 3 valence electrons. All 3 electrons are used to form bonds with F (1 electron per bond), so the central C atom has **0 lone electron pairs**.\n\n  Steric number = bonding domains + lone pairs = 3 + 0 = 3.\n\n### Step 3: Assign electron geometry from steric number\nVSEPR theory states that a steric number of 3 corresponds to a **trigonal planar** electron geometry (this accounts for all electron domains, bonding and nonbonding). Since there are no lone pairs on C, the molecular geometry is also trigonal planar, but electron geometry (which describes the arrangement of all electron domains) matches this.\n\n**Answer: Trigonal planar**",

      "llm_answer": "Murray Edwards College (a women’s college of the University of Cambridge, formerly known as New Hall until 2008) has a formal heraldic crest and coat of arms that evolved to reflect its identity, legacy, and renaming. Below are the key details:\n\n### Core Context\nThe original coat of arms was granted to New Hall in 1957. When the college renamed in 2008 (honoring benefactors Ros and Steve Edwards, and first principal Dame Rosemary Murray), the College of Arms granted an updated version in 2009, retaining foundational elements while adding new symbolic details.\n\n### Technical \"Crest\" (Heraldic Definition)\nIn strict heraldic terms, the crest is the element atop the helmet of the full coat of arms:\n- On a wreath of gold (Or) and blue (Azure, the college’s colors), a demi-lion rampant (red, Gules) stands holding a silver (Argent) book (garnished gold). The book is inscribed with \"MURRAY EDWARDS\" (replacing the original \"NEW HALL\" inscription from the New Hall era). The lion symbolizes strength and courage, while the book represents academic learning.\n\n### Full Coat of Arms (Loosely Referred to as \"Crest\" by Many)\nThe full heraldic achievement includes additional symbolic elements:\n1.  **Shield (Retained from New Hall):** A blue (Azure) shield featuring a gold (Or) chevron (symbolizing community and protection) between three silver (Argent) five-pointed stars (mullets). Each silver star is charged with a smaller red (Gules) star, representing academic excellence and guidance.\n2.  **Supporters (Added in 2009):** Two female figures flanking the shield: one representing Learning (holding a book) and the other representing Citizenship (holding a civic crown). They stand on a grassy compartment dotted with red roses (honoring the Edwards family) and white daisies (honoring Dame Rosemary Murray, whose nickname was \"Daisy\").\n3.  **Motto:** The college retains its original Latin motto Age Age, translated as \"Forward, Forward\" or \"Act, Act,\" reflecting its mission to empower women to progress personally and professionally.",

      "llm_answer": "In Michigan, the minimum sentence for second-degree murder (MCL 750.317) is not set by a universal statutory mandatory minimum. Instead, it is determined by the state’s advisory sentencing guidelines, which consider two key factors: an offender’s prior criminal history (Prior Record Variables, PRVs) and the severity of the offense (Offense Variables, OVs). Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n\n1.  **Statutory Framework**  \n    Second-degree murder is a Class A felony in Michigan, carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. There is no general mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by the statute itself—judges may theoretically impose any term of years, but they are strongly guided by state sentencing rules.\n\n2.  **Advisory Sentencing Guidelines**  \n    Under the Michigan Sentencing Guidelines, the recommended minimum sentence range (the time an offender must serve before parole eligibility) is calculated using a grid that pairs PRV scores (0 for no prior convictions, higher for past offenses) with OV scores (points assigned for aggravating circumstances like weapon use, victim vulnerability, or cruelty).  \n    For the least aggravated cases (e.g., first-time offenders with no prior record, PRV score 0, and only the mandatory 10 points from OV2 for the victim’s death), the guidelines recommend a minimum sentence range of 150 to 300 months (12.5 to 25 years). Judges may depart from this range if they find substantial and compelling reasons, but such downward departures are rare for second-degree murder.\n\n3.  **Enhancements**  \n    Additional mandatory minimums may apply in specific circumstances:\n    -   **Felony Firearm Enhancement (MCL 750.227b):** If the murder was committed with a firearm, a mandatory 2-year sentence is added consecutively to the murder sentence.\n    -   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Cases involving hate crime motivation, murder of a police officer/first responder, or habitual offender status will result in higher recommended minimum ranges, potentially up to life imprisonment without parole in limited instances.\n\nIn summary, the baseline guideline-recommended minimum sentence for the least serious second-degree murder cases starts at 12.5 years, but this varies widely based on prior record and offense details, with no universal statutory mandatory minimum.",

The increased acidity arises from two key factors:\n1.  **Strong inductive electron withdrawal**: Fluorine is highly electronegative, and its proximity to the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group (adjacent ortho position) creates a strong inductive effect that stabilizes the conjugate base (benzoate ion) by pulling electron density away from the negatively charged oxygen.\n2.  **Steric hindrance**: The small fluorine atom causes slight twisting of the -COOH group out of the benzene ring plane. This reduces resonance stabilization of the neutral acid form, making it easier to lose a proton (H⁺).\n\nMinor variations (e.g., 3.25–3.30) may appear in different sources depending on experimental conditions, but 3.27 is the widely accepted reference value.",

Manumission granted them citizenship (with varying degrees of rights, expanding over time from the Republic to the Empire), but they held a lower social and political status than free-born citizens. They faced social stigma, often had restricted access to high office, and were tied to certain obligations to their former owners.\n- Above freedmen were the free-born citizen classes: **plebeians** (common free-born citizens, who gradually gained political rights over time) and **patricians** (the wealthy, aristocratic elite with exclusive political power in the early Republic).\n\nIn short, while slaves occupied the lowest rung of Roman society overall, the lowest class of citizens specifically was the freedmen (liberti).",

      "llm_answer": "It seems \"2rare\" might be a typo, likely referring to the rarest birth dates. Rarity can vary by region due to cultural preferences, hospital scheduling practices, and calendar quirks, but these are among the most uncommon:\n\n1.  February 29 (Leap Day)\n    This is the most statistically rare date globally because it only occurs every 4 years (during leap years). The probability of being born on February 29 is roughly 1 in 1,461 (since 4 years contain 1,461 days: 3×365 + 366), compared to 1 in 365 for non-leap days. People born on this day are often called \"leaplings.\"\n\n2.  Major holidays (varies by country)\n    In many Western countries, dates tied to major public holidays are consistently rare. For example:\n    - December 25 (Christmas Day) and December 24 (Christmas Eve)\n    - January 1 (New Year's Day)\n    - July 4 (U.S. Independence Day)\n    These are rare because hospitals typically avoid elective procedures (like scheduled inductions or C-sections) on holidays, and there may be subconscious avoidance of conceiving to avoid holiday births. A 2019 analysis of U.S. birth data (1994–2014) found December 25 was the least common birth date overall, followed by January 1 and December 24.\n\nRarity can shift in other cultures: for example, dates considered unlucky in some traditions (like the 13th of a month in Western cultures, or certain lunar calendar dates in East Asia) may also see fewer births.",

      "llm_answer": "The term \"the prestige music composer\" is highly subjective, as musical prestige depends on genre, historical era, cultural context, and individual artistic influence. There is no single definitive answer, but below are iconic composers widely regarded as prestigious across different musical traditions:\n\n### 1. Classical Music (Western)\n- **Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750)**: A towering figure of the Baroque era, Bach revolutionized counterpoint, harmony, and organ music. His works (e.g., The Well-Tempered Clavier, Brandenburg Concertos) are foundational to Western classical music, studied by musicians worldwide for their structural perfection and emotional depth.\n- **Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791)**: A child prodigy and master of the Classical era, Mozart composed over 600 works spanning symphonies, operas (e.g., The Marriage of Figaro), and concertos, known for their elegance, melodic genius, and technical precision.\n- **Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827)**: A bridge between the Classical and Romantic eras, Beethoven redefined the scope of symphonic music (e.g., Symphony No. 9) with his innovative structures and emotional intensity, cementing the composer as a visionary artist rather than just a court musician.\n\n### 2. Film Music\n- **John Williams (b. 1932)**: The most decorated film composer in history, Williams’ scores for Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Schindler’s List have become cultural touchstones, blending classical orchestration with memorable, narrative-driven melodies.\n- **Ennio Morricone (1928–2020)**: A legendary Italian composer, Morricone redefined film scoring with his experimental, genre-blending work on Spaghetti Westerns (e.g., The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and dramatic films, winning an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement and a competitive Oscar for The Hateful Eight.\n\n### 3. Jazz & Contemporary Classical\n- **Duke Ellington (1899–1974)**: A pioneer of big band jazz, Ellington composed over 1,000 works (e.g., Take the \"A\" Train) and elevated jazz from popular entertainment to a respected art form.\n- **Philip Glass (b. 1937)**: A leading figure of minimalism, Glass’ repetitive, hypnotic compositions (e.g., Einstein on the Beach) have influenced classical, film, and pop music, reshaping 20th-century contemporary music.\n\n### 4. Cultural & Regional Traditions\n- **Liu Tianhua (1895–1932)**: A foundational composer of modern Chinese classical music, he adapted traditional string instruments like the erhu with Western compositional techniques, creating works that remain central to Chinese musical education.\n\nIn short, \"prestige\" in music is tied to an artist’s ability to innovate, influence future generations, and transcend cultural or temporal boundaries. The \"most prestigious\" composer often depends on the musical context in which the question is posed.",

Over time, the two gods were syncretized, meaning their identities and cult practices merged, so Mutunus Tutunus is often recognized as a Roman equivalent or alternate name for Priapus in many classical sources.\n\nWhile Priapus was occasionally linked to other Roman fertility deities like Liber Pater (the Roman counterpart to Dionysus) due to shared themes, these are not direct alternate names but rather related figures in Roman religious tradition.",
