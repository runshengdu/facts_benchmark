Here’s a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Statutory Base Sentence**\n    Under Michigan Compiled Laws § 750.317 (the defining statute for second-degree murder), there is no mandatory minimum sentence. The offense is punishable by imprisonment in state prison for either life or \"any term of years,\" meaning the law does not set a fixed lower limit on the sentence length in the base case. Probation is not an option, as second-degree murder is a felony punishable by life imprisonment, which is excluded from probation eligibility under MCL § 769.13.\n\n2.  **Advisory Sentencing Guidelines**\n    Michigan uses advisory sentencing guidelines that recommend minimum and maximum sentence ranges based on two factors:\n    -   **Prior Record Variables (PRVs):** Reflect the defendant’s criminal history.\n    -   **Offense Variables (OVs):** Reflect the severity of the murder (e.g., use of violence, victim vulnerability).\n    For a first-time offender with the lowest possible offense severity score (no aggravating factors beyond the murder itself), the minimum guideline range is typically 120 months (10 years). Judges may depart below this range only if they identify substantial and compelling justifications for doing so.\n\n3.  **Enhanced Mandatory Minimums**\n    Certain aggravating circumstances can trigger mandatory minimum sentences, including:\n    -   **Firearm Enhancement (MCL § 750.227b):** If the murder was committed with a firearm, a mandatory consecutive 2-year prison sentence is added (longer for repeat firearm offenders).\n    -   **Habitual Offender Status (MCL § 769.10 et seq.):** Defendants with prior felony convictions may face increased mandatory minimum and maximum sentences, depending on the number of prior offenses.\n    -   **Victim-Specific Aggravations:** Murders involving vulnerable victims (e.g., children, elderly), terrorism, or other severe factors can elevate guideline ranges or trigger additional mandatory terms.\n\nIn summary, while there is no statutory mandatory minimum for second-degree murder in Michigan, the lowest recommended minimum under state sentencing guidelines for first-time offenders with minimal aggravation is 10 years. Mandatory minimums may apply in cases with specific enhancements.",

The three stars emphasize unity across these principles.\n- **Red lion (in the chief and crest)**: Derived from the Edwards family’s coat of arms, in recognition of the transformative philanthropic support of Ros and Steve Edwards, whose donation led to the college’s renaming.\n- **Crest’s demi-lion and held star**: Mirrors the chief’s lion to reinforce the Edwards family connection, while the held star ties back to the college’s foundational values.\n\nThe college uses both the full coat of arms and simplified versions (e.g., just the crest’s lion and star) for official branding, ceremonies, and merchandise.",

This is primarily due to the electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) of fluorine, which stabilizes the negatively charged carboxylate conjugate base formed after deprotonation.\n- While fluorine can exhibit a weak electron-donating resonance effect (+R), this is less impactful than the inductive withdrawal in the ortho position, where the proximity of fluorine to the carboxyl group amplifies the inductive effect. Minor steric effects (twisting the carboxyl group out of the benzene ring plane, reducing resonance overlap between the ring and carboxyl group) may also contribute to the increased acidity.\n\nNote: Slight variations (e.g., 3.26–3.28) may appear in different sources due to experimental conditions, but 3.27 is the widely accepted consensus value.",

Here are some possibilities based on common media tropes:\n\n1.  **Easter eggs in TV shows**: Some mystery or thriller series hide house numbers that tie to episode counts or key plot details. For example:\n    - In the Korean drama *The Secret House* (2022), the series has 120 episodes, but no canonical \"secret house number\" is central to the plot.\n    - Shows like Sherlock or Breaking Bad often embed numerical clues, but a direct \"house number = episode count\" tie-in would depend on a specific season or episode.\n2.  **Puzzle/riddle context**: If this is a riddle, it might require wordplay (e.g., \"episode\" abbreviations or numerical double meanings). For instance, if \"episodes\" refers to a specific series’ episode count, the \"secret house number\" could be a hidden code within that count.\n\nTo get the correct answer, please share more details: Which show or puzzle is this related to?

Primarily day laborers, unemployed individuals, or subsistence farmers with minimal to no property, the proletarii were excluded from military service in the Republic because they could not afford to supply their own equipment. They were exempt from property taxes but had minimal political influence—their votes in the Roman assemblies were heavily weighted against them, and their main \"contribution\" to the state was seen as raising children (proles, from which their name derives). They were the lowest class of free-born citizens.\n\n2.  **Freedmen (Liberti)**: Former slaves legally manumitted by their owners. Over time, especially under the Roman Empire, freedmen could gain full citizenship rights, but they remained socially and often legally inferior to all free-born citizens, including the proletarii. In the Republic, they were barred from holding public office, and even wealthy freedmen faced social stigma. As the lowest-ranking citizens by status, freedmen are widely considered the overall lowest citizen class in ancient Rome.\n\nImportantly, enslaved people are not included here, as they were not recognized as citizens in Roman society.",

However, we can interpret the term based on common mathematical operations where \"ungluing\" is used, and identify relevant notations depending on the context:\n\n1.  **Ungluing as reversing a quotient (topology/set theory)**\n    In topology, \"gluing\" refers to creating a quotient space by identifying (gluing together) points of a set. \"Ungluing\" reverses this, separating points that were previously identified. The resulting \"unglued set\" is typically the original set before the gluing operation, which is denoted using standard set notation: curly braces `{}` for explicit sets (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`) or a variable label (e.g., `X` if the quotient space was written as `X/~`, where `~` is the equivalence relation used for gluing).\n\n2.  **Ungluing as splitting into disjoint components**\n    If \"unglued set\" refers to a collection of disjoint sets that were previously combined, the disjoint union (a formal way to \"unglue\" merged sets) is denoted by:\n    -   `⊔` (e.g., `A ⊔ B` for the disjoint union of sets `A` and `B`), or\n    -   `∐` (the categorical coproduct, a generalized version of the disjoint union for multiple sets).\n\n3.  **Non-technical or misinterpreted \"unglued\"**\n    If the term is used informally to mean a set with non-connected elements (e.g., a disconnected set in topology), there is no standard symbol for the set itself. We simply describe the set as disconnected using its label (e.g., \"Set `A` is disconnected\").\n\nIf you have a specific context or operation in mind (e.g., topology, set theory, or a particular textbook definition), clarifying it would help pinpoint a more precise notation.",

Leap days only occur every 4 years (to align the calendar with the Earth’s orbit around the sun), so statistically, only 1 in every 1,461 people is born on February 29. For comparison, the probability of being born on any other standard day is 4 in 1,461 over a 4-year cycle.\n\n2.  **Major Holiday Dates**  \n    The next rarest birth dates tend to fall on major cultural or religious holidays, as elective inductions or C-sections are often scheduled to avoid these days. Examples vary by region but include:\n    - December 25 (Christmas Day, in Christian-majority countries)\n    - January 1 (New Year’s Day, globally)\n    - July 4 (Independence Day, in the United States)\n    - Dates around Thanksgiving (U.S.) or other region-specific holidays, since these are variable but often avoided for planned births.\n\nIf you meant \"two rare birth dates,\" the top two would be February 29 and a major holiday like December 25.",

As the southernmost major thrust in the Himalayan orogen (mountain-building zone), it drives significant tectonic activity:\n- It is responsible for large, destructive earthquakes due to ongoing tectonic compression between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates.\n- It shapes landscape evolution by uplifting rock formations, creating steep escarpments, and influencing the morphology of the Himalayan foreland basin and adjacent plains (e.g., the Ganges plain).\n\n### Alternative (Less Prevalent) Full Forms in Geography:\n1.  **Mountain Front Thrust**: A broader term for thrust faults that form the boundary between a mountain range and an adjacent low-lying foreland basin, applicable to orogenic (mountain-building) zones worldwide (not just the Himalayas).\n2.  **Multi-Factor Typology**: A niche classification approach in human geography used to categorize regions based on overlapping criteria (e.g., climate, land use, socioeconomic factors), though this is far less common than the tectonic definitions.",

Such surnames were often assigned to individuals who contrasted with the stereotypical traits of a bear—for example, someone small, gentle, or unassuming. In some cases, the negative framing was also used humorously or to ward off bad luck by disavowing association with the animal (a common folk belief in Slavic cultures to avoid invoking a creature’s spirit).\n\nThe most famous bearer of the name is Pavel Nedvěd, the legendary Czech footballer known for his skill and tenacity on the pitch.",

He is revived using Claire Bennet's regenerative blood, so this is not his final death.\n\n2.  **Physical Killing (Season 3 Finale: \"An Invisible Thread\")**: By Season 3, Nathan has allied with the government to capture and register evolved humans. Sylar, seeking to evade capture and infiltrate the government's anti-evolutionary task force, confronts Nathan and shoots him in the chest, killing him physically. Sylar then uses his shape-shifting ability to assume Nathan's identity, posing as him for months. Only a small group of characters (including Angela and Peter Petrelli, and Matt Parkman) know the truth and cover up the murder.\n\n3.  **Definitive, Permanent Death (Season 4 Finale: \"Brave New World\")**: As Sylar poses as Nathan, Nathan's memories and personality begin to merge with Sylar's, creating an unstable hybrid identity. Matt Parkman attempts to use his telepathic ability to erase Sylar's consciousness and fully restore Nathan, but the attempt backfires, blending their identities irreparably. To preserve Nathan's legacy and stop Sylar's violent instincts from resurfacing, Angela Petrelli enlists Matt to completely rewrite Sylar's memories, convincing him he is Nathan. This results in the original Nathan Petrelli's consciousness being permanently erased; while a \"Nathan\" figure remains, it is Sylar with Nathan's memories, not the true Nathan.

If you meant summer camp name (a common misspelling of \"camp\" as \"cem\"):\n    Popular examples include \"Sunny Pines Summer Camp,\" \"Lakeview Adventure Camp,\" or \"Tropical Beach Camp.\" These names often evoke warmth, outdoor fun, and summer vibes.\n\n2.  If you meant summer gemstone name (a misspelling of \"gem\" as \"cem\"):\n    Birthstones tied to summer months are:\n    - July: Ruby (a vibrant red gem symbolizing passion)\n    - August: Peridot (a bright green gem linked to joy and growth)\n    - September: Sapphire (a deep blue gem associated with wisdom, overlapping with late summer)\n\n3.  If you meant summer event name:\n    Examples range from local festivals like \"Coastal Summer Seafood Festival\" to global events like \"Tomorrowland\" (a famous summer music festival) or \"Notting Hill Carnival\" (a summer street festival in London).\n\nIf you clarify the intended word for \"cem,\" I can provide a more precise answer!",

Below are some of the most universally celebrated and prestigious composers across key categories, each revered for their innovation, influence, and enduring legacy:\n\n### 1. Classical Music (Timeless Prestige)\n- **Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750):** Widely hailed as one of the greatest composers in Western music history. His works (e.g., the Brandenburg Concertos, *The Well-Tempered Clavier*) perfected counterpoint and harmonic structure, laying the foundational framework for classical music.\n- **Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791):** A child prodigy whose output spans symphonies (e.g., Symphony No. 40), operas (*The Marriage of Figaro*), and concertos. His music is celebrated for its elegance, emotional depth, and technical mastery.\n- **Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827):** Revolutionized classical music by bridging the Classical and Romantic eras. Works like the 9th Symphony, *Moonlight Sonata*, and *Fidelio* expanded the expressive range of music, emphasizing individual emotion and innovation.\n- **Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827):** Revolutionized classical music by bridging the Classical and Romantic eras. Works like the 9th Symphony, Moonlight Sonata, and *Fidelio* expanded the expressive range of music, emphasizing individual emotion and innovation.\n\n### 2. Prestigious Film Composers (Cultural and Award-Winning Impact)\n- **John Williams (b. 1932):** The most decorated film composer in history (5 Oscars, 25 Grammys). His scores for *Star Wars*, Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, and Schindler's List are synonymous with iconic cinematic storytelling, defining the sound of modern blockbusters.\n- **Ennio Morricone (1928–2020):** A legendary Italian composer whose work redefined film scoring. His spaghetti western themes (e.g., The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and dramatic scores (The Mission) earned him an Oscar for lifetime achievement, plus competitive acclaim.\n- **Hans Zimmer (b. 1957):** A contemporary giant known for innovative, sweeping scores. Works like Inception, The Lion King, and Dune blend electronic and orchestral elements, shaping the sound of 21st-century film music.\n\n### 3. Prestigious Contemporary/20th-Century Composers\n- **Philip Glass (b. 1937):** A pioneer of minimalism, whose repetitive, hypnotic works (e.g., Einstein on the Beach, *Koyaanisqatsi*) have influenced classical, film, and popular music alike.\n- **Quincy Jones (b. 1933):** A cross-genre visionary who composed film scores (The Color Purple), produced Michael Jackson's Thriller, and redefined jazz and pop arrangement. He has 28 Grammys and is celebrated for his ability to unify diverse musical traditions.\n\nIf you had a specific era, genre, or cultural context in mind, narrowing the focus would yield a more targeted \"prestigious\" composer.",
