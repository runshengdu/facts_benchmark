Complete the octets for the Fluorine atoms (adding 6 electrons to each). This uses up all 24 electrons. The central Carbon atom has 3 bonds and **0 lone pairs**.\n\n**2. Count the Electron Domains:**\n*   There are **3 bonding pairs** (the bonds to the Fluorines).\n*   There are **0 lone pairs** on the Carbon.\n*   Total electron domains (Steric Number) = **3**.\n\n**3.

      "llm_answer": "The correct legal answer for the penalty for Second-Degree Murder in Michigan, according to **MCL 750.317**, is:\n\n**\"Imprisonment in the state prison for life, or any term of years.\"**\n\nHowever, what this actually means in practice is complex. Here is the breakdown:\n\n### 1. There is no fixed \"Mandatory Minimum\"\nUnlike some states that mandate \"25 years to life,\" Michigan **does not have a statutory mandatory minimum** for Second-Degree Murder. Theoretically, the sentence is indeterminate.\n\n### 2. The Minimum is Determined by Sentencing Guidelines\nIn Michigan, the minimum sentence is calculated using a scoring system based on:\n*   **Prior Record Variables (PRVs):** The defendant's criminal history.\n*   **Offense Variables (OVs):** The severity and cruelty of the specific crime.\n\nThese scores place the defendant on a sentencing grid. For example:\n*   A defendant with **no criminal history** might face a guideline minimum range of roughly **10 to 16 years** (120–192 months).\n*   A habitual offender with a **high OV score** might face a guideline minimum range of **27 to 45 years** (324–540 months) or life.\n\nThe judge must generally select a minimum sentence within that calculated range.\n\n### 3. \"Life\" vs. \"Term of Years\"\nBecause Second-Degree Murder is distinct from First-Degree Murder, a **\"Life\" sentence is parolable.**\n*   If sentenced to **\"Life,\"** the defendant acts as if they have a minimum sentence, and they generally become eligible for parole consideration after **15 years** (or 10 years if the crime was committed before certain dates in the past).\n*   If sentenced to a **\"Term of Years\"** (e.g., 20 to 40 years), the defendant must serve the minimum sentence (20 years) before becoming eligible for parole.\n\n### Summary\nWhile there is no single number that applies to everyone, the practical minimum is determined by the specific circumstances of the crime and the defendant's history. It almost always results in a significant prison term (usually decades), but it is strictly defined as **\"Life or any term of years.\"**\n\n***Disclaimer:** I am an AI, not an attorney. Sentencing laws are subject to change and interpretation by judges. You should consult a criminal defense attorney in Michigan for advice on a specific case.*",

The core foundation of the island consists of lava formations.\n2.  **It is covered in Limestone:** While the base is volcanic, much of what you see on the surface today is limestone. Over millions of years, as sea levels changed and the land uplifted, coral reefs grew on top of the volcanic rock. This created the distinctive terraced landscape found on the island.\n3.  **It is Extinct:** There is no active volcanic activity on Curaçao today.\n4.  **Visible Evidence:** You can see the exposed volcanic rock in the highest parts of the island, specifically at **Mount Christoffel** (Christoffelberg). The darker, jagged rocks there are the ancient volcanic core, which differs from the white limestone found near the coast.\n\nSo, while it does not look like a stereotypical volcano (like a cone shape) and is not active, it is geologically an island of **volcanic origin**.",

They owned little to no property and were too poor to pay taxes or, historically, to serve in the military.\n*   **The Name:** The term comes from the Latin word *proles* (offspring). They were called this because their only contribution to the Roman state was their children (future citizens).\n*   **Also known as:** They were sometimes called the **capite censi** (those counted by the head), because they didn't have property to list during the census, so the censors simply counted their physical presence.\n\n**2. The Plebeians (The Broader Category)**\nIn general history classes, the answer is sometimes given as **Plebeians** (or Plebs). However, this is a broad category that essentially means \"everyone who is not a noble Patrician.\"\n*   While the Proletarii were technically Plebeians, the Plebeian class also included wealthy merchants and middle-class farmers. Therefore, \"Plebeian\" is not specific enough to describe the *lowest* class.\n\n**3. Slaves (The Semantic Trap)**\nSlaves were the lowest people in Roman society, but **they were not citizens**. Therefore, they are not the correct answer to your specific question.\n\n**Summary**\nIf this is for a multiple-choice test:\n*   If **Proletarii** is an option, pick that.\n*   If the only options are Patrician, Plebeian, and Slave, pick **Plebeian**.",

The Physical Death (Season 3)**\nNathan is murdered by **Sylar**. In the Season 3 finalé (\"An Invisible Thread\"), Sylar telekinetically **slits Nathan’s throat** in a hotel room, killing him instantly.\n\n**2. The Post-Death Twist**\nImmediately after his murder, Nathan's mother (Angela Petrelli) convinces Matt Parkman to use his telepathy to brainwash Sylar. Parkman forces Sylar to believe that *he* is Nathan Petrelli. Because Sylar is a shapeshifter, his body physically morphs into Nathan's, and he retains Nathan's memories. For a large portion of the next season, \"Nathan\" is actually Sylar living unknowingly as Nathan.\n\n**3. The Final Death (Season 4)**\nEventually, Sylar’s true consciousness begins to fight back, and the two personalities battle for control of the body. In the Season 4 episode \"The Wall,\" the \"Nathan\" personality realizes he is just a memory construct and cannot ultimately defeat Sylar.\n\nTo save his brother Peter, the \"Nathan\" personality decides to let go. He says his final goodbyes to Peter and **throws himself off the top of a building**. As he falls, the Nathan personality fades away completely, and Sylar takes full control of the body again, healing from the fall.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   **How he physically died:** Throat slit by Sylar.\n*   **How the character ended:** The imprinted memory of Nathan committed suicide by jumping off a roof to let Sylar take over.",
