      "llm_answer": "The correct answer is the **Battle of Palmito Ranch**.\n\nHere is the breakdown of why this is the answer, depending on how specific you want to be:\n\n### 1. Land Battles (The Standard Answer)\nIn terms of land battles fought on North American soil, the **Battle of Palmito Ranch** is the southernmost engagement.\n*   **Location:** Near Brownsville, Texas (at the very southern tip of Texas).\n*   **Coordinates:** Approximately 26° North.\n*   **Context:** It is historically significant not only for being the southernmost battle but also for being the **last** land battle of the Civil War, fought on May 12–13, 1865—more than a month after Robert E. Lee had surrendered at Appomattox.\n\n*Comparison:* While Florida is very far south, the Battle of Palmito Ranch in Texas is actually geographically further south than the **Battle of Fort Myers** in Florida (which is roughly 26.6° North).\n\n### 2. Naval Engagements (The Technical Answer)\nIf the question includes naval warfare (warships fighting at sea), the answer changes because Confederate commerce raiders operated globally.\n\n*   **Bahia, Brazil:** The Confederate raider *CSS Florida* was rammed and captured by the *USS Wachusett* in the harbor of Bahia (Salvador), Brazil, on October 7, 1864. This took place in the Southern Hemisphere (roughly 13° South), making it the southernmost hostile engagement of the war.\n\n**Summary:**\nIf this is for a general history quiz, the answer is undoubtedly the **Battle of Palmito Ranch**.",

This foundation was formed by underwater volcanic eruptions roughly 90 million years ago during the Cretaceous period.\n2.  **Limestone Surface:** While the base is volcanic, much of what you see on the surface today is **sedimentary limestone**. Over millions of years, the volcanic base was submerged, allowing coral reefs to grow over it. Later tectonic activity uplifted an island, turning those ancient reefs into the limestone terraces and bluffs that characterize the island's landscape today.\n3.  **No Active Volcanoes:** Curaçao does not have any active or dormant volcanoes. It is not like the islands in the neighboring Lesser Antilles active arc (such as Montserrat or St. Vincent) or Hawaii.\n\n**Summary:**\nCuraçao is an island of **volcanic origin** that has been heavily capped by **limestone coral formations**.

While the college was renamed in 2008 to honor Dame Rosemary Murray and the Edwards family, these arms are still used for formal occasions (matriculation, graduation, and on college merchandise).\n\n**The design consists of:**\n*   **The Shield (Arms):** A black background (*Sable*) featuring a silver **dolphin** swimming upwards (*palewise*). On the sides, there are curved white sections (*flaunches*) containing three black stars (*estoiles*).\n*   **The Crest (The piece atop the helmet):** A **demi-boar** (specifically an ermine boar) holding a **double rose** (a red and white Tudor-style rose) between its legs.\n\n**Symbolism:**\n*   **The Boar:** This is taken from the family crest of **Dame Rosemary Murray**, the college’s first President.\n*   **The Rose:** A pun on Dame Rosemary's first name.\n*   **The Dolphin:** Represents intelligence, sociability, and the idea of \"swimming against the tide\" (appropriate for a pioneering women's college).\n\n### 2. The Modern Logo\nIf you are looking for the image found on the college website and letterheads, it is a modern graphic design rather than a traditional crest.\n\n*   **Description:** It consists of **two intersecting wavy lines** (representing a pathway or the initials 'M' and 'E') usually appearing in purple/pink and grey, accompanied by the text \"Murray Edwards College.\"",

      "query": "2nd degree murder michigan minimum sentence",
      "llm_answer": "**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI, not an attorney. Sentencing laws are complex and subject to change. The following information is for educational purposes based on Michigan statutes and legal guidelines. You should consult with a qualified criminal defense lawyer in Michigan for specific legal advice.*\n\nHere is the breakdown of the minimum sentence for Second-Degree Murder in Michigan:\n\n### The Short Answer\nThere is **no single mandatory minimum number of years** set by the written statute for every defendant.\n\nThe punishment is officially listed as \"imprisonment in the state prison for life, or any term of years.\" Practically speaking, the minimum sentence is determined by **Sentencing Guidelines**, which calculate a range based on the defendant's criminal history and the circumstances of the crime.\n\n### The Detailed Breakdown\n\n**1. The Statute (MCL 750.317)**\nUnder Michigan law, the penalty for Second-Degree Murder is \"Life or any term of years.\" This gives the judge discretion to sentence a defendant to a Life sentence (which is parole-eligible, unlike First-Degree Murder) or a specific term of years (e.g., 20 to 40 years).\n\n**2. The Sentencing Guidelines**\nMichigan uses a grid system to determine the minimum sentence. A score is calculated based on two factors:\n*   **Prior Record Variables (PRV):** The defendant's past criminal history.\n*   **Offense Variables (OV):** The specific details of the murder (e.g., extreme cruelty, use of a weapon, multiple victims).\n\nThese scores intersect on a grid to create a **sentencing range** (e.g., 144 to 240 months). The judge must usually select a minimum sentence within that range.\n*   *Example:* If a person has no criminal record (low PRV) but the crime was brutal (high OV), the guidelines might recommend a minimum sentence between 12 and 20 years.\n*   *Example:* If a person is a habitual offender, the minimum recommendation will be significantly higher.\n\n**3. \"Truth in Sentencing\"**\nMichigan is a \"Truth in Sentencing\" state. This is critical to understand: **A prisoner must serve 100% of their minimum sentence** before they can even be considered for parole. There is no \"good time\" credit that reduces the minimum sentence for violent crimes like murder.\n\n*   If a judge sentences a defendant to specific years (e.g., \"25 to 50 years\"), the defendant **must** serve exactly 25 years before becoming eligible for parole.\n\n**4. The \"Life\" Sentence Distinction**\nIf a defendant receives a \"Life\" sentence for Second-Degree Murder (rather than a term of years), they are generally subject to the jurisdiction of the parole board after serving **15 years** (or 20 years, depending on when the crime was committed). However, getting parole on a life sentence is difficult and not guaranteed.\n\n### Summary\nWhile there is no \"hard\" statutory floor (like a mandatory 10 years), the practical minimum is determined by the guidelines. For Second-Degree Murder, it is very rare for a minimum sentence to be less than **10 to 12 years**, and it is frequently **15, 20, or 25+ years** depending on the severity of the case.",

Who they were**\nThe *Proletarii* were the poorest class of **Roman citizens**. They owned little to no property. Because the Roman military and voting systems were originally based on wealth and land ownership, the *Proletarii* were ranked in the lowest census class.\n\n**2. The meaning of the name**\nThe term comes from the Latin word *proles*, meaning \"offspring\" or \"children.\" They were called this because they were too poor to pay taxes or serve in the military (unlike the land-owning classes); therefore, their only contribution to the Roman state was producing children to populate the Republic/Empire.\n\n**3. Also known as *Capite Censi***\nThey were sometimes referred to as the *capite censi*, meaning \"those counted by the head.\" When the Roman census was taken, they didn't have property to list, so they were simply counted as individual heads.\n\n***\n\n**Common Misconceptions:**\n\n*   **Slaves:** Slaves were the lowest group of people in Rome, but they were considered property, **not citizens**. Therefore, they are not the answer to your specific question.\n*   **Plebeians:** While \"Plebeians\" refers to the general commoner class (anyone who wasn't a noble Patrician), this group was very broad. By the later years of the Republic, many Plebeians were wealthy and powerful. The *Proletarii* were the absolute bottom rung of the Plebeian class.\n*   **Freedmen (Liberti):** These were former slaves who had been granted freedom and citizenship. While they had limited political rights and low social status, the *Proletarii* represents the standard economic \"lowest class\" of freeborn citizens.",

The Specific Film**\nYou must look for film packages labeled **SX-70**. It is currently manufactured and sold by the modern **Polaroid** company. You can buy it in Color or Black & White.\n\n**2. Why this specific film?**\n*   **ISO/Speed:** The Land Camera 1000 has a low sensitivity to light. SX-70 film is rated at a lower ISO (approx. 160) to match the camera's shutter speed.\n*   **The Battery:** The vintage Land Camera 1000 does not have its own battery. **The battery is built into the film cartridge.** When you insert a fresh pack of SX-70 film, it powers the camera.\n\n**3. Crucial Warnings**\n*   **Do NOT buy \"i-Type\" film:** Although it fits in the camera, i-Type film does not contain a battery. Your camera will not turn on.\n*   **Refrain from \"600\" film (unless you have a filter):** 600 film is the same size, generally cheaper, and has a battery, *but* it is too sensitive to light for the 1000. If you use it without a special Neutral Density (ND) filter, your photos will turn out completely white (overexposed).\n\n**Summary of what to buy:**\nLook for the blue (color) or gray (B&W) box with **SX-70** written on the front.",

Internal Structure (De Facto)**\nInternally, Transnistria functions exactly like an independent country with its own constitution.\n*   **Executive:** There is a **President** (Head of State) who is elected by popular vote, and a **Prime Minister** (Head of Government) who is appointed by the President.\n*   **Legislature:** It has a unicameral parliament called the **Supreme Council**.\n*   **Political Atmosphere:** While it has a multi-party system, the political landscape is heavily dominated by the \"Obnovlenie\" (Renewal) party. This party is closely linked to **Sheriff**, a massive business conglomerate that controls a vast portion of the region's economy (supermarkets, gas stations, TV channels, etc.). Because of this, some analysts describe it as a \"captured state\" effectively run by a business monopoly.\n\n**2. International Status (De Jure)**\n*   **Unrecognized State:** Transnistria is a breakaway state. While it is *de facto* independent (meaning it controls its own borders, currency, and army), it is **not recognized** by any United Nations member state.\n*   **View of the World:** The international community recognizes the territory as part of **Moldova** (specifically, the Administrative-Territorial Units of the Left Bank of the Dniester).\n*   **Russian Influence:** The region is politically, economically, and militarily dependent on Russia, maintaining a \"frozen conflict\" status since the early 1990s.\n\n**Summary**\nIf you are filling out a test or a form, the technical answer is **Semi-presidential Republic.**\n\nIf you are analyzing the geopolitical reality, the answer is an **unrecognized, de facto independent state** heavily influenced by a local oligarchy (Sheriff) and the Russian Federation.",

The lead single, \"Supposed to Be Loved,\" was released in late 2023.\n2.  **God Did**: This was his 13th studio album, which was released in **August 2022**.\n\n*Note: DJ Khaled frequently uses Arabic phrases. \"Aalam\" (عالم) means \"World\" or \"Universe,\" while the phrase \"Allah A'lam\" means \"God knows best.\" It is possible you may have heard him use these phrases in interviews or social media clips and mistaken them for an album title.*",

Technically, he \"dies\" twice: once physically, and later explicitly.\n\nHere is the correct breakdown of events:\n\n**1. The Physical Death (Season 3, Finale: \"An Invisible Thread\")**\nThis is the moment Nathan actually dies. He engages in a fight with **Sylar** at the Stanton Hotel. Sylar uses telekinesis to **slit Nathan’s throat**, killing him almost instantly.\n\n**2. The \"Resurrection\" (The Twist)**\nImmediately after Nathan dies, his mother, Angela Petrelli, convinces Matt Parkman to use his telepathy to \"scrub\" Sylar’s mind. Matt forces Sylar to forget who he is and believe that *he* is Nathan Petrelli. Because Sylar is a shapeshifter, his body physically morphs into Nathan’s, and the \"real\" Nathan’s memories are implanted into Sylar’s brain.\n*   *Result:* Nathan’s body is dead/burned, but a version of Nathan lives on in Sylar's body.\n\n**3. The Final Death (Season 4, Episode: \"The Wall\")**\nThroughout Season 4, Sylar’s consciousness begins fighting to get his body back. Eventually, Peter Petrelli enters Sylar’s mind to help the \"Nathan\" personality.\n\nWhile inside the mindscape, \"Nathan\" realizes that he is just a collection of memories and not the real soul of his brother. He realizes that as long as he fights for control, Sylar will remain a threat. To save Peter and end the struggle, **Nathan voluntarily lets go of the ledge he is holding onto in the mindscape, falling into the abyss.** This act extinguishes the last remnant of Nathan Petrelli, allowing Sylar to take full control of his body again.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   **Cause of death:** Throat slit by Sylar.\n*   **Final end:** Voluntarily letting his consciousness fade away inside Sylar’s mind.",

      "llm_answer": "The correct point group for the triptycene molecule is **$D_{3h}$**.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the symmetry elements that determine this assignment:\n\n1.  **Identity ($E$):** The molecule remains unchanged if you do nothing.\n2.  **Principal Axis ($C_3$):** There is a $C_3$ rotation axis passing through the two bridgehead carbons. Rotating the molecule by 120° along this axis maps the three benzene rings onto one another.\n3.  **Perpendicular Axes ($3 \\times C_2$):** There are three $C_2$ axes perpendicular to the principal $C_3$ axis. These axes pass through the center of the molecule and slice through the middle of the benzene rings.\n4.  **Horizontal Mirror Plane ($\\sigma_h$):** There is a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the $C_3$ axis that cuts the molecule horizontally in half (bisecting the benzene rings). The top half of the molecule is a perfect reflection of the bottom half.\n5.  **Vertical Mirror Planes ($3 \\times \\sigma_v$):** There represent the planes containing the $C_3$ axis and each of the three benzene rings (blades).\n\nBecause the molecule possesses a principal axis $C_3$, three perpendicular $C_2$ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane $\\sigma_h$, it fits the definition of the **$D_{3h}$** point group.",
