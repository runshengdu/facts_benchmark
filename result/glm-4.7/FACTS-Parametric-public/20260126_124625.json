This uses 6 electrons.\n    *   Complete the octets of the three Fluorine atoms (using the remaining 18 electrons).\n    *   The Carbon atom ends up with only 6 electrons in its valence shell (3 single bonds), which is an incomplete octet. However, because Fluorine is highly electronegative, it will not form double bonds (to complete the octet) as that would result in a positive formal charge on Fluorine, which is unstable.\n3.  **Determine Electron Geometry:**\n    *   Look at the central atom (Carbon). It has **3 bonding domains** (connected to 3 Fluorines) and **0 lone pairs**.\n    *   According to VSEPR theory, 3 regions of electron density arrange themselves as far apart as possible to minimize repulsion.\n    *   The geometric shape for 3 domains is **trigonal planar**.\n\nSince there are no lone pairs on the central atom to distort the shape, both the electron geometry and the molecular geometry are trigonal planar.",

He is depicted as a neglectful, rock star musician who gives her a leather jacket but refuses to take her with him.\n2.  **Implication vs. Confirmation:** The show never explicitly states his name on screen (likely due to legal reasons). However, the character's appearance, the musical context, and the backstory created for Alex—being raised by a groupie mother on the road—heavily imply that the father is Thurston Moore.\n3.  **Creator Confirmation:** This connection has been widely acknowledged by fans and is supported by the show's writers, who wrote Alex's background to mirror the daughter of a famous indie rock icon.\n\nWhile the character of Alex Vause in the show is loosely based on the real-life Cleary Wolitzer (whose father was also a musician), the specific \"rock star\" figure depicted in the TV series is intended to be Thurston Moore.",

      "llm_answer": "The correct answer is **SX-70 film**.\n\nHere are the important details you need to know about using film in the Polaroid Land Camera 1000:\n\n**1. The Native Format: SX-70**\nThe Polaroid Land Camera 1000 (marketed as the \"OneStep\" in the US) was designed specifically for **SX-70 integral film**. This film has a lower ISO (light sensitivity) of 160, which matches the camera's shutter and exposure settings.\n\n**2. Current Availability**\nSince Polaroid stopped making original SX-70 film years ago, you must buy the modern version produced by **Polaroid (formerly Polaroid Originals / The Impossible Project)**. Look for film packaging labeled **\"Polaroid SX-70\"**.\n\n**3. What about 600 or i-Type film?**\nYou will often see people asking if you can use the more common 600 or i-Type film in this camera. Here is the breakdown:\n\n*   **600 Film:** You *can* physically put 600 film in the camera, and it will power the camera (because 600 film contains a battery, just like SX-70 film). However, 600 film is much \"faster\" (ISO 640). Because your Land Camera 1000 is designed for slower film, your photos will turn out **completely white and overexposed**. To use 600 film, you must put a neutral density filter (ND filter) over the camera's electric eye (light sensor) or over the lens to trick the camera.\n*   **i-Type Film:** You **cannot** use i-Type film. It is the same shape and speed as 600 film, but it **does not contain a battery**. The Polaroid Land Camera 1000 draws its power from the battery inside the film pack. If you use i-Type, the camera will not turn on.\n\n**Summary**\nTo take photos without modifications or filters, you must purchase **Polaroid SX-70 Color or Black & White film**.",

This is often calculated using the Michigan Sentencing Guidelines (which are advisory, not mandatory). These guidelines take into account the defendant's prior criminal history and the severity of the offense (Offense Variables).\n3.  **Parole Eligibility:** In Michigan, for a sentence of \"any term of years,\" the \"minimum\" date set by the judge is the earliest date the inmate can be considered for parole. Due to \"Truth in Sentencing\" laws, the inmate must serve every day of that minimum sentence (including time for good behavior usually calculated at the end of the minimum term for disciplinary credits in some cases, but generally they serve 100% of the minimum for violent crimes).\n\n**Summary:** While there is no hard number (like \"15 years\") mandated by law, judges typically impose substantial minimum sentences (often ranging from 10 to 40 years) based on the facts of the case.",

They were distinct from slaves (who were not citizens) and freedmen.\n*   **Why they were the lowest:** In ancient Rome, social class and voting rights were determined by the **Census** (a count of wealth and property). The *Proletarii* owned little to no property (or less than 11,000 *asses*). Because they had no property tax to pay, the Roman state considered them useful only for producing children (the word comes from *proles*, meaning \"offspring\").\n*   **The broader group:** They belonged to the general category of **Plebeians** (common people), but not all Plebeians were Proletarii; some Plebeians were wealthy landowners or merchants. The *Proletarii* were specifically the poorest of the citizen body.\n\n**Summary of Roman classes regarding this question:**\n1.  **Patricians:** The aristocratic elite.\n2.  **Equites:** The \"knights\" or wealthy merchant class.\n3.  **Plebeians:** The common citizens (ranging from wealthy to poor).\n4.  **Proletarii:** The lowest class of citizens (property-less).\n5.  **Slaves:** Non-citizens (not considered a \"class of citizen\").",

The Bhojpuri TV Show: \"Ram Pyaare Hum Tumare\"**\nThis is the most probable match. \"Ram Pyaare Hum Tumare\" is a popular Bhojpuri television comedy/drama series that aired on the **Zee Ganga** (formerly Zee Chhath) channel.\n*   **Number of Episodes:** While an exact official count is not always public for regional daily soaps, the show aired daily (Monday to Saturday) for a significant period. It started around **2018** and ran for roughly **one to two years**.\n*   **Estimated Count:** This means it likely has between **250 and 500 episodes**.\n\n**2. The Hindi Show: \"Hari Mirch Lal Mirch\"**\nIf you are thinking of a Hindi show from the past (early 2000s) where the main character's name was **Ram Pyaare**.\n*   **Details:** This was a comedy show that aired on **DD National** and later on **SAB TV**. The main protagonist was a simple man named **Ram Pyaare**.\n*   **Number of Episodes:** The show had a successful run, but exact records are scarce.
