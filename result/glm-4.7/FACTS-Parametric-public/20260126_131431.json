This uses 6 electrons (3 pairs).\n    *   The remaining 18 electrons are placed as lone pairs on the three Fluorine atoms to complete their octets (each Fluorine gets 3 lone pairs).\n    *   Note that the central Carbon atom ends up with only 6 electrons in its valence shell (3 bonding pairs), resulting in a formal charge of +1. Carbon has **no lone pairs** in this structure.\n\n3.  **Determine the Steric Number:**\n    *   The steric number is the sum of the number of atoms bonded to the central atom and the number of lone pairs on the central atom.\n    *   Bonded atoms: 3\n    *   Lone pairs: 0\n    *   Steric Number = 3\n\n4.  **Identify the Geometry:**\n    *   A steric number of 3 corresponds to a **trigonal planar** electron geometry. The molecular shape is also trigonal planar, with bond angles of approximately $120^\\circ$.\n\n*(Note: $CF_3^+$ is isoelectronic with $BF_3$, sharing the same structure.)*",

This limestone cap sits on top of an ancient, extinct volcanic basement (the \"Curaçao Lava Formation\"), but the island's surface and defining geology are sedimentary rock.\n2.  **Location:** Curaçao is part of the ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao), which lie on the continental shelf of South America. They are geologically an extension of the continent, unlike the volcanic islands of the Lesser Antilles (like St. Lucia or Martinique), which were formed by deep-sea volcanic eruptions.",

It represents intelligence, friendliness, and sociability. In heraldry, the dolphin is often a symbol of diligence and swiftness.\n*   **The Stars:** The two stars represent the two main benefactors of the college: **Rosemary Murray** (the first President) and the **Edwards family** (Steve Edwards and family), whose renaming donation in 2008 allowed the college (formerly New Hall) to secure its future.\n*   **The Colors:** Black and Gold were the colors of the old New Hall crest, while the White and the new design reflect the college's modern identity.\n\n### **Note on the Logo**\nWhile the \"crest\" is the heraldic shield described above, the college often uses a modern **logo** for branding. This logo frequently simplifies the crest down to just the **black dolphin** icon, often accompanied by the college name in a clean, modern typeface. The college's motto is often cited as \"**Audacious**\" (reflecting their spirit), though this is a modern branding tagline rather than a traditional Latin inscription on the coat of arms.",

The Highest Warning Category (Signal Number) in 2007**\nIn 2007, the highest tropical cyclone wind signal issued by PAGASA was **Signal Number 4**.\n*   *Note:* PAGASA introduced \"Signal Number 5\" (Super Typhoon) only in 2015 (after Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan). Therefore, in 2007, Signal #4 was the maximum category, representing winds of more than 185 km/h.\n\n**2. The Strongest Typhoon to Hit in 2007**\nIf you are looking for the name of the typhoon that reached this highest category (Signal #4) and was a \"Super Typhoon\" during that year, it was **Typhoon Mitag** (local name: **Mina**).\n*   **Typhoon Mina (Mitag)** struck the Philippines in late November 2007. It intensified into a Category 4 super typhoon and prompted the raising of Signal Number 4 in parts of Luzon (particularly the Bicol and Cagayan regions).\n\n**3. The Typhoon with the Highest Peak Intensity (in PAR)**\nIf you are looking for the typhoon that achieved the highest wind speed *classification* (Category 5) while within the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), even if it did not make a direct landfall at that strength, it was **Typhoon Sepat** (local name: **Egay**).\n*   **Typhoon Egay (Sepat)** reached Category 5 status (peak winds of 260 km/h) in August 2007 as it passed through the northern part of the Philippines.\n\n**Summary Answer:**\nFor most general contexts regarding the most significant/high-category storm that *impacted* the country in 2007, the answer is **Typhoon Mina (Mitag)**.",

      "llm_answer": "The correct answer depends on the level of specificity required, but the most technically accurate term for the lowest class of citizens in ancient Rome is the **Proletarii** (or the **Capite Censi**).\n\nHere is the breakdown of why this is the answer and how it differs from other common terms:\n\n**1. The Proletarii (or Capite Censi)**\nIn the Roman census, citizens were divided into classes based on their wealth (specifically their property). The *Proletarii* were citizens who owned little to no property. Because they did not meet the minimum property threshold to serve in the legions (as soldiers had to provide their own equipment), they were exempt from military service in the early republic.\n*   **Meaning:** The name comes from the Latin *proles*, meaning \"offspring.\" The joke was that their only contribution to the state was producing children.\n*   **Capite Censi:** This term means \"head count.\" It refers to the fact that these citizens were counted by the head in the census rather than by the amount of property or wealth they possessed.\n\n**2. Plebeians (Common Misconception)**\nWhile many people might answer \"Plebeians,\" this is technically a broader category. Plebeians were all Roman citizens who were not Patricians (aristocrats).\n*   **Why it's incorrect:** The Plebeian class included everyone from the homeless poor to incredibly wealthy merchants and landowners (the *Equites*). Therefore, \"Plebeian\" is not synonymous with \"lowest class.\"\n\n**3. Freedmen (Liberti)**\nFreedmen were former slaves who had been granted citizenship. While they were citizens, they were not fully equal; they could not hold public office, and they owed certain duties and respect to their former masters. However, they could (and often did) become wealthy.\n\n**Summary**\n*   If the question requires the specific property class defined by the census: **Proletarii** (or **Capite Censi**).\n*   If the question is a simple binary between the elite and the commoners: **Plebeians**.\n*   **Excluded:** **Slaves**, because they were not considered citizens.",

Instead, the vote resulted in a runoff between Sokratis Famellos (who came in first) and Pavlos Polakis (who came in second).\n\n**Sokratis Famellos** was eventually elected as the leader of Syriza in the second round of voting held on **December 8, 2024**.\n\nIf you must provide the name associated with the November 24 date as the winner of that day's vote, the answer is **Sokratis Famellos**.",

When placed in the *ortho* position, it pulls electron density through the sigma bonds toward itself. This withdraws electron density from the carboxyl group, which helps stabilize the negative charge of the conjugate base (the carboxylate anion), making it easier to lose a proton.\n3.  **Proximity (The Ortho Effect):** Because the fluorine is very close to the carboxyl group in the *ortho* position, this inductive effect is significantly stronger than it would be in the *meta* or *para* positions (where the pKa is roughly 3.86 and 4.14, respectively).\n\n*Note: Depending on the specific reference source and measurement conditions (temperature, solvent), the value is typically cited between **3.17 and 3.27**.*",

Because this was released while he was still a member of The First Edition and had a very different psychedelic/rock sound, it is often excluded from the count of his \"solo career\" discography.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   If you are answering a standard trivia question or looking for the start of his famous country era: **Love Lifted Me**.\n*   If you are looking for the very first studio album ever released under his name: **Kenny Rogers (1967)**.",

The plot of this movie revolves around Viper unleashing a deadly \"Doomsday Virus\" (or a pathogen intended to wipe out humanity), linking the two terms \"Doomsday\" and \"Viper.\"\n2.  **Tara Reid** starred in the 2008 TV movie *Vipers*. While the movie is about a deadly outbreak of snakes (a \"doomsday\" scenario), she is the lead actress.\n3.  **Rhona Mitra** starred in the 2008 movie *Doomsday*. While there is no character named Viper, she is the lead actress of a film with that exact title.\n4.  **Ashly Burch** is the voice actress for the character **Viper** in the popular video game *Valorant*. While not directly named \"Doomsday,\" the character is associated with toxic gas and apocalyptic themes.\n\nIf you are looking for the actress who specifically played the character named **Viper**, the answer is **Sandra Hess**.",

Here are the most likely intended answers depending on the context of the question:\n\n1.  **First woman to *contest* the election:**\n    The answer is **Sehar Kamran**. In March 2018, she became the first woman in Pakistan's history to contest the election for the Deputy Chairman of the Senate (representing the PPP), although she lost to Saleem Mandviwalla.\n\n2.  **First woman **Deputy Speaker** (National Assembly):**\n    If the question is confusing the Senate with the National Assembly, the answer is **Begum Ashraf Abbasi**. She was the first woman Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan (elected in 1973).\n\n3.  **First woman **Leader of the Opposition** in the Senate:**\n    The answer is **Sherry Rehman** (from 2018 to 2021) or **Dr. Shezra Mansab Ali Khan** (briefly in 2015, though some sources dispute the duration/title transfer). Sherry Rehman is widely recognized as the first full-term female Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.\n\n**Summary:**\nStrictly speaking, the position of **Deputy Chairman of the Senate** has never been held by a woman. **Sehar Kamran** holds the distinction of being the first woman to *run* for the office.",

      "llm_answer": "The correct answer to the question \"triptycene point group\" is **$D_{3h}$**.\n\n**Explanation:**\nTriptycene is a rigid, paddlewheel-shaped molecule consisting of an arene ring (benzene) bridging the 9 and 10 positions of an anthracene unit (or structurally viewed as three benzene rings fused to a bicyclo[2.2.2]octatriene core).\n\nTo determine the point group, we look at its symmetry elements:\n1.  **Principal Axis ($C_3$):** The molecule has a 3-fold rotational axis passing through the bridgehead carbons (the \"apex\" and the \"base\" of the paddlewheel).\n2.  **Horizontal Mirror Plane ($\\sigma_h$):** There is a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the principal axis that bisects the molecule. This plane passes through the middle of the bond connecting the two bridgehead carbons, reflecting the top half of the molecule onto the bottom half.\n3.  **Perpendicular $C_2$ Axes:** There are three $C_2$ axes perpendicular to the principal axis, located in the horizontal plane, passing through the spaces between the arene blades.\n4.  **Vertical Mirror Planes ($\\sigma_v$):** There are three vertical mirror planes that contain the principal axis and pass through the centers of the benzene rings.\n\n**Why it is not $D_{3d}$:**\nWhile molecules with this general shape can sometimes have $D_{3d}$ symmetry (which includes an inversion center, $i$), triptycene specifically lacks an inversion center. Inversion would map the bridgehead carbons to themselves (which is fine), but it would attempt to map the bridging carbons (connected to the bridgehead) to the distal carbons of the benzene rings on the opposite side (which are chemically distinct). Because these atoms are not equivalent, inversion is not a symmetry operation.\n\nSince it possesses $C_3$, $3C_2$, $\\sigma_h$, and $3\\sigma_v$ but lacks inversion, the correct point group is **$D_{3h}$**.",
